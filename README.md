### Hi there!

A few words about my activity.

🌱 At this time, I'm improving my qualifications at Yandex.Praktikum on the role of "Web developer". I'm currently learning Frontend with VanillaJS and React.js. I plan to study a server side development.

😄 I'm interested in learning new technologies in my spare time. Thus, I'm interested in Linux (which I use in my daily activities), AI and languages such as Go and Python.

🤝 I'm open to cooperation and teamwork.
